# MY NEWS STAND (mynewsstand.net)



### Description

My News Stand is a program that lets the user create, save, and share their favorite news articles. 
A frequent problem people face is being bombarded by a single news source or being unable to find articles that they would either like to reread or show others. My News Stand hopes to aliviate to issue of limited resources to find informative pages and use them later. It can also be used as a news comparison, making bias or misinformation more apparent.

The application is made in Bootstrap/CSS, Mustache, Javascript, HTML, Express, and Node.
Javascript, Express, and Node are the backend while Bootstrap/CSS, Mustache, and HTML are front end.

### Prerequisites

In the terminal, "npm i (Insert software name here. No capitalization)" for all prerequsites except bootstrap.
